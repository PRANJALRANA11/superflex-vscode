# Element AI for VS Code

Welcome to the [**Element AI**](https://elementai.dev/) extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension is designed to assist frontend engineers by converting visual sketches and design elements into clean, maintainable HTML and CSS code. Element AI leverages AI to understand design patterns, code styles, and existing components in your codebase to ensure consistency and efficiency.

## Features
